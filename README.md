# blog-system

You know what to Do...
download zip.
Run Npm install.
let the packages get installed.
I used MongoDB so you need to create an account if you don't have one and then paste the database application url in the URI link.
I'll add the comment in the app.js file, That's where you need to paste the URI link.
after all tha packages are installed and the URI link is pasted you are ready to use the application.
run "nodemon app" into terminal and enjoy the fully functional blog system.
